# Eden


> You were in Eden, the garden of God. Every kind of precious stone adorned you: ruby, topaz, and diamond, beryl, onyx, and jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and emerald. Your mountings and settings were crafted in gold, prepared on the day of your creation. 
> 
> Ezekiel 28:13


Eden is a sandbox for [the Abraham project](http://abraham.ai) to test pipelines for creating generative art with machine learning.
